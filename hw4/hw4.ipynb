    "Let's discuss this implementation more in detail.\n",
    "## Inputs and outputs of a RNN\n",
    "We start with the two input vectors of the RNN, the input vector and the hidden state.\n",
    "### Input $x$\n",
    "The number of units is represented as $n_x$. It can be understood as the number of units in a single timestep of a single training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A timestep in a single input example is represented as $x^{(i) \\langle t \\rangle }$. The timesteps are indexed as $t$. Normally, a single training example $x^{(i)}$ will consist of multiple time steps $T_x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training examples are grouped into so-called mini batches $x$ of size $m$. Thus, the shape of a mini batch is $(n_x,m,T_x)$. $x$ is thus a 3-dimension tensor and this will be our input into the RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will be working with mini-batches of training examples, we will need a 2D slide $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ of the same shape of our mini batch, $(n_x, m)$. In our implementation, this will be the variable `xt`.\n",
    "### Hidden State $a$\n",
    "The second input required in a RNN is the hidden state $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, an activation function. The hidden state is passed from one step to the next. It shares similarities with our input vector $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it has a length $n_{a}$, and if we include a mini-batch of size $m$, the shape of the mini-batch will be $(n_{a},m)$. The hidden state also makes use of the same index $t$ to iterate and on each loop it uses a 2D slice $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ of shape $(n_{a}, m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, we will have two variables for the hidden state. They will be called `a_prev` and `a_next`.\n",
    "Similarly, on each step, we produce an output vector.\n",
    "### Output $\\hat{y}$\n",
    "The ouput $\\hat{y}$ is also a 3D tensor. Its shape is $(n_{y}, m, T_{y})$, where $n_{y}$ represents the number of units in the vector representing the prediction. As it is the case with the input, $m$ reflects the number of examples in the mini batch and $T_{y}$ the number of steps in the prediction. In our implementation, we will be defining this variable as `y_pred`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we go more in depth and look at a single time step $t$, we have a 2D slice $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ with shape $(n_{y}, m)$. Similarly, the variable in our code for this 2D slice will be called `yt_pred`.\n",
    "## The RNN cell\n",
    "In the animation above, we see that the RNN model consists basically of looping over a single cell over the index $t$. As we outlined above, we take the input consisting of two vectors, the current input $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, and the previous hidden state $a^{\\langle t - 1\\rangle}$. \n",
    "At the same time, we will be passing to the next RNN cell two outputs. They are the hidden state  $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ and the prediction $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$.\n",
    "Let's start by implementing the RNN cell!\n",
    "## Task 1. Simple Cell (4 points)\n",
    "In this task, you will have 4 individual exercises:\n",
    "* **(1 pt.)** First, start by implementing the hidden state $a$ with the tanh activation function. It is defined as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "a^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\tanh(W_{aa} a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle} + W_{ax} x^{\\langle t \\rangle} + b_a).\n",

    "* **(1 pt.)** Fourth return `accumulator` and $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ , $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$.\n",
    "The function to implement consists of the following arguments:\n",
    "* `xt` - This is the input data at timestep $t$, a pytorch tensor of shape $(n_x, m)$\n",
    "* `a_prev` - Hidden state at timestep \"t-1\", a pytorch tensor of shape $(n_a, m)$\n",

    "* - ba -  Represents the bias with shape $(n_a, 1)$\n",

    "## The ARMA Process\n",
    "The family of ARMA processses (such as ARIMA and SARIMA) plays a major role in times series forecasting. In the first half of the homework, we will look deeper into understanding important elements around ARMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by remembering that for a time series $\\{X_t\\}$ with $E(X^2_t) < \\infty$, its mean function is defined by $\\mu_X(t) = E(X_t)$ and the sample mean, for the $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ observations by $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum^n_{t=1} x_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, its covariance function is \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\gamma_X(r,s) = Cov(X_r, X_s) \\\\ \n",
    "= E[(X_r - \\mu_X(r))(X_s - \\mu_X(s))]\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "for all integers $r$ and $s$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that for $\\{X_t\\}$ to be (weakly) stationary, it must fulfill two conditions. First, $\\mu_X(t)$ must be independent of $t$, and $\\gamma_X(t+h, t)$ must be also independent of $t$ for each h.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the seminar, we applied the autocovariance and the autocorrelation functions to a dataset without deeper discussing their definition. Now, we look deeper into them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autocovariance function\n",
    "The autocovariance function or ACVF of $\\{X_t\\}$ at lag $h$ is $\\gamma X(h) = Cov(X_{t+h}, X_t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the observations $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$, the sample autocovariance function can be similarly defined by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\hat{\\gamma} (h) := n^{-1} \\sum^{n - |h|}_{t=1} (x_{t+|h|} - \\bar{x})(x_t - \\bar{x})\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "for $-n < h < n$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autocorrelation function\n",
    "The autocorrelation function or ACF makes use of ACVF as following $\\rho_X(h) = \\frac{\\gamma X(h)}{\\gamma X(0)} = Cor(X_{t+h}, X_t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can write the sample autocorrelation function as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\hat{\\rho} (h) = \\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}(h)}{\\hat{\\gamma}(0)}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "for $-n < h < n$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also remember a useful property of covariances, the linear property. It means that if that if $EX^2 < \\infty ,EY^2 < \\infty,EZ^2 < \\infty$ and $a$,$b$,and $c$ are any real constants, then, we can do $Cov(aX + bY + c, Z) = a Cov(X, Z) + b Cov(Y, Z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the cornerstones of classic forecasting is the Moving Average Process $MA(q)$. It can be defined, if the time series $\\{X_t\\}$ is $Xt = Z_t + \\theta_{1}Z_{t−1} +\\ldots+ \\theta_{q}Z_{t−q}$, where $\\{Z_t\\} \\sim WN(0,\\sigma^2)$, and $\\theta_{1},\\ldots,\\theta_{q}$ are constants, and $WN$, White Noise, being a sequence of uncorrelated random variables, each with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2$ defined by $\\sigma^2 = E(X − \\mu)^2$. \n",
